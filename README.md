Targets is an online, multiplayer, action game where players compete to shoot the most targets that spawn around all of them as quickly as possible. 
The client-side is written in C++ using OpenGL and GLFW, while the server side is written using Java Sockets.
Primarily developed on **Windows** 8.1 using Microsoft Visual Studio (.sln file included), but also tested on **Ubuntu** 18, building using CMake.
Really should run on any \*nix systems that have GLFW installed, but mileage may vary.

Developed by Kevin Kellar, initially as a quarter-long project for Professor Christian Eckhardt's Intro to Computer Graphics (CPE 471).
Special thanks to Professor Eckhardt and Professor Zoe Wood for the base template code help start this project.
