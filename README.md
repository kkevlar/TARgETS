# TARgETS

Targets is an online, multiplayer, action game where players compete to shoot the most targets that spawn around all of them as quickly as possible. 
The client-side is written in C++ using OpenGL and GLFW, while the server side is written using Java Sockets.
Primarily developed on **Windows** 8.1 using Microsoft Visual Studio (.sln file included), but also tested on **Ubuntu** 18, building using CMake.
Really should run on any \*nix systems that have GLFW installed, but mileage may vary.
Ubuntu will probably need `libglfw3-dev` and `libglm-dev` and similar packages are availible for brew on Mac I think.

Developed by Kevin Kellar, initially as a quarter-long project for Professor Christian Eckhardt's Intro to Computer Graphics (CPE 471).
Special thanks to Professor Eckhardt and Professor Zoe Wood for the base template code help start this project.

This project is hosted (or at least it should be) both on [github](https://github.com/kkevlar/targets) and on Professor Eckhardt's [Mixed Reality Lab](http://mixedrealitylab.io/projects2.html).

## Gameplay

All players remain in the center of the "field", but can turn to face any direction within the cylinder of targets spawning around them.
