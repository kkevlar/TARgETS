<p><img src="media/one.png" ></p>
<p>Targets is an online, multiplayer, action game where players compete to shoot the most targets that spawn around all of them as quickly as possible. 
The client-side is written in C++ using OpenGL and GLFW, while the server side is written using Java Sockets.
Primarily developed on <strong>Windows</strong> 8.1 using Microsoft Visual Studio (.sln file included), but also tested on <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 18, building using CMake.
Really should run on any *nix systems that have GLFW installed, but mileage may vary.
Ubuntu will probably need <code>libglfw3-dev</code> and <code>libglm-dev</code> and similar packages are availible for brew on Mac I think.</p>
<p>Developed by Kevin Kellar, initially as a quarter-long project for Professor Christian Eckhardt&#39;s Intro to Computer Graphics (CPE 471).
Special thanks to Professor Eckhardt and Professor Zoe Wood for the base template code help start this project.</p>
<p>This project is hosted (or at least it should be) both on <a href="https://github.com/kkevlar/targets">github</a> and on Professor Eckhardt&#39;s <a href="http://mixedrealitylab.io/projects2.html">Mixed Reality Lab</a>.</p>
<h2 id="download-and-play-">Download and Play!</h2>
<p>TARgETS is an online multiplayer game, so it may be a bit more difficult to just download and try out. 
The &quot;client&quot; games won&#39;t be able to run without communication with the server, even just for a one player game.</p>

<h3 id="server-setup">Server Setup</h3>
<p>The Server is a Java backend written using Java ServerSockets. 
It was originally developed using Eclipse, but can be run with a variety of java tools.</p>
<p>Recommended Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone/download the repo (see above)</li>
<li>Install JDK 8 and  <ul>
<li>Either: Ant or Eclipse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the server<ul>
<li><code>cd server &amp;&amp; ant build &amp;&amp; bash ./runserver</code></li>
<li>Run ShootServerMain.java in Eclipse</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="client-setup">Client Setup</h3>
<p>Depending on the version downloaded, the client will either be configured to connect to <code>localhost</code> or <code>kevinkellar.com</code>.
If the server (see above) is running on the same machine as you intend to run the client, then change (or leave) the client configuration to use <code>localhost</code>.</p>
<p>Recommended Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the ip of wherever the server is being hosted. <ul>
<li>If the server is on the same machine as the client (<code>localhost</code>), then use <code>127.0.0.1</code>.  </li>
<li>Do not use the &quot;domain&quot; version of the server. The *nix client can&#39;t do DNS lookup for whatever reason. Just provide the IP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change the IP at the top of webclient.cpp to the IP from step 1. <ul>
<li><code>#define SERVER_ADDRESS &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Open the .sln file in Visual Stuio, or use CMake.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>All players remain in the center of the &quot;field&quot;, but can turn to face any direction within the cylinder of targets spawning around them.</p>

<p>The player with the highest score will have a yellow halo pulsing around their cursor.

<h3 id="initial-networked-game">Initial Networked Game</h3>
<p>Much of this project&#39;s work was in making the networked game from scratch. 
The image below shows four players all running on the same machine, with their cursor positions mirrored for all other players.</p>

<h3 id="splash-screen-animation">Splash Screen Animation</h3>
<p>The splash screen has normal mapping, specular lighting, and makes use of instance rendering. 
Feel free to tweak the values in <code>Billboard.cpp</code> to try out different animations.</p>
<p><img  src="media/six.gif" width="1200"></p>
<h3 id="sky-cylinder">Sky-Cylinder</h3>
<p>Instead of a skybox, the project makes use of a sky-cylinder, where the space texture is mapped along the inside of the cylinder, as if it was unrolled to be a rectangle.
Should be less distorted-looking for a long, rectangular skybox texture.</p>

<h3 id="scoreboard">Scoreboard</h3>
<p>The scoreboard has not been implemented yet.
The currently-winning player has a halo.</p>
